        <ol>
            <li>Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl; make a well in the center.
                Whisk together water and oil in a small bowl; pour into flour mixture. Stir just until blended, mixture will be lumpy.
            </li>
            <br>

            <br>
            <li>Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle. Cook until bubbles form and edges are dry. Flip, then cook until bottoms

            </li>
            <br>
